    "Monte Carlo Estimation of Pi: Mathematical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo method for estimating π is based on the principle of geometric probability within a known area. The method utilizes a square and a quarter circle inscribed within it. By randomly generating points within the square and calculating the proportion that falls inside the quarter circle, we can estimate π.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup:\n",
    "   - Consider a square with side length 2r, and a quarter circle of radius r inscribed within it.\n",
    "   - If we set r = 1, the area of the square (A_square) becomes 4, and the area of the quarter circle (A_circle) is π/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Sampling:\n",
    "   - Generate points (x, y) randomly within the square. The points have coordinates ranging from -r to r for both x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determining Point Location:\n",
    "   - A point is inside the quarter circle if its distance from the origin (0, 0) is less than or equal to the radius r, i.e., if x^2 + y^2 <= r^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimation of π:\n",
    "   - The ratio of the number of points that fall inside the quarter circle (N_inside) to the total number of points (N_total) approximates the ratio of the areas, A_circle/A_square = π/4.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the estimate of π is given by π ≈ 4 * (N_inside / N_total).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Works:\n",
    "The method works because the probability of a point falling inside the quarter circle is proportional to the area of the quarter circle relative to the area of the square. As the number of randomly generated points increases, the law of large numbers ensures that the proportion of points inside the quarter circle converges to the actual area ratio, allowing for an increasingly accurate estimation of π.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Setup:\n",
    "- Needles of length 'l' are dropped onto a surface with parallel lines spaced a distance 'd' apart.\n",
    "- The orientation (angle θ) of each dropped needle relative to the lines is random, ranging from 0 to π radians (0 to 180 degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Probability of Crossing:\n",
    "- The probability 'P' that a needle crosses a line depends on the ratio of the needle's length to the distance between the lines, as well as π.\n",
    "- The formula linking 'P' to π is P = (2l) / (πd), derived from integrating over all possible angles and positions, considering uniform distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimating π:\n",
    "- By observing how often the needles cross the lines (N_cross) out of the total number of drops (N_total), we can estimate 'P' as P ≈ N_cross / N_total.\n",
    "- Rearranging the formula for 'P' to solve for π gives us π ≈ (2lN_total) / (dN_cross), allowing us to estimate π based on the outcomes of the experiment.\n",
